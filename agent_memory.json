    "Inflation is when the prices of things\u2014like food, clothes, and services\u2014go up over time. This means that the same amount of money buys you less than it used to. For example, if a loaf of bread used to cost $1 and now it costs $1.50, that\u2019s inflation. It usually happens because there\u2019s more money in the economy or because things cost more to make. So, essentially, inflation means your money doesn\u2019t stretch as far as it used to.",
